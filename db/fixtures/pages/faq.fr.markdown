# Frequently Asked Questions

## What kind of questions can I ask here?
**Questions about %site_name%, of course!** As long as your question is:

* detailed and specific
* written clearly and simply
* of interest to at least one other person somewhere

... it is welcome here. No question is too trivial or too "newbie". Oh yes, and it should be about **%site_name%**.

Please look around to see if your question has already been asked (and maybe even answered!) before you ask. If you end up asking a question that has been asked before, that is OK and deliberately allowed. Other users will hopefully edit in links to related or similar questions to help future visitors find their way.

It's also perfectly fine to ask and answer your own question, but pretend you're on [Jeopardy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy! "Jeopardy"): phrase it in the form of a question.

## What kind of questions should I not ask here?
**Avoid asking questions that are subjective, argumentative, or require extended discussion.** This is not a discussion board, this is a place for questions that can be answered!

## Be nice.
**Treat others with the same respect you'd want them to treat you.** We're all here to learn together. Be tolerant of others who may not know everything you know. Bring your sense of humor.

## Be honest.
Above all, be honest. If you see misinformation, vote it down. Insert comments indicating what, specifically, is wrong. Even better â€” edit and improve the information! Provide stronger, faster, superior answers of your own!

##What is reputation?

%site% is run by you! If you want to help us run the site, you'll need reputation first. Reputation is a (very) rough measurement of **how much the %site% community trusts you.** Reputation is never given, it is earned by convincing other users that you know what you're talking about.

Here's how it works: if you post a good question or helpful answer, it will be voted up by your peers: you gain **10** reputation points. If you post something that's off topic or incorrect, it will be voted down: you lose **2** reputation points. You can earn up to **200** reputation per day, but no more. (Note that votes for any posts marked "community wiki" do not generate reputation.)

Amass enough reputation points and %site% will allow you to go beyond simply asking and answering questions:

> 15  Vote up  
> 15  Flag offensive  
> 50  Leave comments  
> 100 Vote down (costs 1 rep), edit community wiki posts  
> 200 Reduced advertising  
> 250 Vote to close or reopen your questions, create new tags  
> 500 Retag questions  
> 2000  Edit other people's posts  
> 3000  Vote to close or reopen any questions  
> 10000 Delete closed questions, access to moderation tools  
> At the high end of this reputation spectrum there is little difference between users with high reputation and moderators. That is very much intentional. We don't run %site_name%. The community does.
